## OpenReview Upload Fields

- Main PDF: `submission/AAAI27_Anonymous.pdf`
- Reproducibility Checklist: `submission/AAAI27_ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf`
- Code and Data Supplement: `submission/code_data_supplement.zip`
- Technical Supplement: leave blank unless adding a separate anonymous PDF.
- Media Supplement: leave blank unless adding anonymous media.
- Country of Institutions: United States.
- License: CC BY 4.0.
- Submission-policy acknowledgements: check only after confirming every author

## arXiv / Source Compilation Package

Use `submission/AAAI27_MetaRoute_arxiv_source.zip` when a system asks for LaTeX source files. This archive is intentionally separate from the code/data supplement.

Included source files:

- `main.tex`
- `main.bbl`
- `references.bib`
- `aaai2027.sty`
- `aaai2027.bst`
- `figures/executable_tradeoffs.pdf`
- `figures/executable_tradeoffs.png`

Validation completed from a clean temporary extraction:

- `pdflatex main.tex`
- `pdflatex main.tex`

Result: compiled successfully with no undefined citations and no missing `figures/executable_tradeoffs.pdf` error.

## Code/Data Supplement

Use `submission/code_data_supplement.zip` only for the AAAI code/data supplement. It is not a complete LaTeX source package and should not be uploaded as the arXiv/source compilation bundle.

The code/data supplement has been scanned for author names, affiliations, and
repository URLs and should remain anonymous during review.
